JeffreyOS is a meticulously crafted digital experience simulating the personal operating system of Jeffrey Epstein. This project is a web-based, high-fidelity OS simulation that runs entirely in your browser.

## Overview

The simulation provides an immersive look into a fictionalized digital environment, complete with a suite of applications, a file system, and interactive narratives. The system state is persisted locally in your browser's `localStorage`, ensuring your session is saved between visits. The interface is designed to be responsive, offering a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

*   **Modern OS Interface:** A complete desktop environment featuring a dynamic wallpaper, an application dock, a system header bar, and an onboarding guide for new users.
*   **Window Management:** A fluid windowing system that supports opening, closing, maximizing, and refreshing applications with smooth animations.
*   **Control Center:** Access system settings, toggle between light and dark themes, and view informational pages like 'About', 'Terms of Service', and 'Privacy Policy'.
*   **Application Suite:** Launch a variety of simulated applications, including:
    *   **Web Apps:** Parody applications such as Jmail, JMessages, JPhotos, and JDrive that load content in a web view.
    *   **Finder:** A file explorer that provides organized access to public documents, including DOJ disclosures and FBI records from The Vault.
    *   **Story App:** An immersive, scroll-driven narrative detailing key events and connections in an interactive format.
*   **Local Persistence:** All application states and user interactions are saved locally, providing a continuous experience across sessions.
